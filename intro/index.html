<h2>An Intro to code</h2>
<p>
    Code is a language like any other, it has grammar, pronouns, and verbs. 
    The only thing that substantially differentiates the two type of language is that you will never learn a coding language completley. 
    Almost Half of all of code is research, you always need to research what functions or methods you need to use to complete a specific task. 
    This can act as an introduction to any of these languages. Some other great resources to learn how to code are:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">full stack academy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing">Khan academy's computer courses</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tutsplus.com/">tutsplus</a></li>
    </ul>
    And some good references to do research while coding are:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a></li>
        <li>And the manual for whatever code you are writing in</li>
    </ul>
    And <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack overflow</a> is a great place to ask questions if you are stuck.
